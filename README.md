# Estimating *V<sub>A</sub>(W)* in *Brassica rapa* using Aster Models

This project estimates the additive genetic variance of lifetime fitness, *V<sub>A</sub>(W)*, in two identical populations of *Brassica rapa* exposed to separate climate regimes (ambient and ambient +3 Celsius). In particular, Aster models for life history analysis combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian Inference were used (see [Geyer et al. 2007](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asm030) and [Shaw et al. 2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/588063)). Analyses provided here are used to supplement Cameron So's Masters thesis (2020). Data was collected in the summer 2019 field season at the Experimental Climate Warming Array within the Koffler Scientific Reserve (University of Toronto) in King City, Ontario.
